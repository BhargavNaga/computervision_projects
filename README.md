# computer vision lab

## lab1 - capture your face image and sharpen it canny , marr hildreth edge detection algorithms

## lab2 - With the help of segmentation, create an output image in which foreground will be your image and background will be the historical image.

## lab3 -For this assignment create a custom image as follows : - On an A4 sheet paper, draw multiple colored circles / dots of different sizes and colors.  Note, the circles should not overlap with each other.- Take image of this A4 sheet Question : From the custom image, count the number of points using watershed algorithm followed by applying steps to count the number of connected components


## lab4 -Create an app / web app that takes arbitrary images as input and display images with Bokeh Effect

## lab5 -  Take two test images of 10 person. In test data you will have 20 images
## Match the test image with dataset images using SIFT and find the accuracy. To match SIFT features, you can use Euclidean Distance
